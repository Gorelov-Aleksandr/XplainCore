Now, to make your model universal and integrate all the methods, you need to rework the structure of your project step by step and add all the necessary components. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Overview of the comparative structure
You already have a basic project structure with several modules and components, so the first step is to understand which parts of the system provide a solution to which problems:

main.py - the main file for starting the service.

Application Folder:

auth.py - for authentication.
data.py - for working with the database (for example, saving the history of observations).
models.py - for models and working with data.
monitoring.py - for Diptychs (for example, metrics or logging).
explainers - here you will find files for different types of phenomena (for example, shapley.py, counterfactual.py).
routers - routers that connect API endpoints.
Connection of new libraries (for example, LIME, SHAP, etc.).

Step 2: Abstractions for developing a generic explainer
In order to integrate all the explainer methods, you need to create a common interface for all explainers. You can do this in the app/explainers/base.py file.

Like this:

python
Copy
Edit
from abc import ABC, abstract method

Class explainer (ABC):
@abstractmethod
async define explain(self, input_data):
pass
This is the creator of the abstraction that all explainers will implement.

Step 3: Implement each method
In each file in explainers/ (e.g. shapley.py, counterfactual.py, feature_importance.py), implement the class that will find the explanation and implement the explain method.

Example for shapley.py:

python
Copy
Edit
from app.explainers.base import explain
import form

class ShapleyExplainer(Explainer):
async define explain(self, input_data):
# Your code for SHAP
shap_values ​​= shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, input_data)
return shap_values
For other methods (LIME, ELI5, etc.) you can create similar classes. The main thing is that they all implement the explain method.

Step 4: Integrate into the service
Now you need to integrate all this into the main service. Open the main.py file and the handler section, which will contain the main method's explanation of what the requests are for:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.explainers.shapley import ShapleyExplainer
from app.explainers.lime import LimeExplainer
from app.models.schema import InputData

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/explain")
async def explain(input_data: InputData, method: str = "shapley"):
if method == "Shapley":
explainer = ShapleyExplainer()
elif method == "lime":
explainer = LimeExplainer()
else:
# Add other methods as needed
return {"error": "Unknown explain method"}

explain = expect explain.explain(input_data)
return explain
Step 5: Develop Data Models
Remember to set up data schemas in app/models/schema.py for all inputs that may be passed in queries, as well as for data that will be retrieved from explainers.

Sample data model for inputs:

python
Copy
Edit
from pydantic import BaseModel

class InputData(BaseModel):
income: int
credit_amount: integer
credit_history: interval
jobs_years: int
debt_to_income_ratio: float
age: international
previous_default: interval
max_features_to_show: interval
Step 6: Update tests
Create tests for the new functionality. For example, in the test_explainers.py file:

python
Copy
Edit
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_shapley_explainer():
input_data = {
"income": 80000,
"loan_amount": 20000,
"credit_history": 7,
"employment_years": 5,
"debt_to_income_ratio": 0.25,
"age": 32,
"previous_defaults": 0,
"max_features_to_show": 5
}
response = client.post("/explain", json=input_data, params={"method": "shapley"})
assert response.status_code == 200
assert "feature_importance" in response.json()

def test_lime_explainer():
input_data = {
"income": 80000,
"loan_amount": 20000,
"credit_history": 7,
"employment_years": 5,
"debt_to_income_ratio": 0.25,
"age": 32,
"previous_defaults": 0,
"max_features_to_show": 5
}
response = client.post("/explain", json=input_data, params={"method": "lime"})
assert response.status_code == 200
assert "feature_importance" in response.json()
Step 7: Run and test
After all changes, start the service using Uvicorn:

beat
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Now you will have the option to provide an explanation for the explanation by specifying the method via the parameter method.

Step 8: Testing and Improving
Once the service is running, test it using different observation methods. Depending on how the service will work,
