I want you to:

Implemented additional features for the XAI service
Improved the current explanations with additional visualization options.
Added more detailed documentation for the endpoint API.
Focused on a specific aspect of the service that I would like to improve, namely addressing the problems of transparency and interpretability of AI, i.e.:
Lack of universal methods for explaining deep learning neural network decisions
Difficulty in interoperability of models with many interacting components
The "black box" problem when working with transformers and the image of language models.
Insufficient methods for verifying the complex AI system
Difficulty in checking the correctness of models in extreme cases
Lack of standards for assessing the acceptability of models.
Complexity of adaptation methods for different regions (medicine, finance)
Lack of industry standards
Problems of validation in highly critical applications
Complexity of presenting views to end users
Lack of universal formats for visualizing interpretations
Problem of user trust in explanations II
Complexity of compliance with GDPR and other regulations
Problem of responsibility for AI system decisions
Lack of clear acceptable conditions
Computational limitations:
High computational methods
Costs of access at first
Problems of scaling understandability methods
Integration with process development:
Complexity of embedding explainability methods in ML development pipelines
Lack of tools for continuous testing of interpretability
Problem of query generation
Multimodal systems:
Complexity of explaining system decisions, enterprises with other types of data
Lack of methods for similar hybrid models
Problems of considering issues of different modalities
Solving the problem, solving without leaking significant data
Protection against attacks on systems vulnerabilities
Balancing between transparency and respect for intellectual property
Methodological problems:
Lack of a single metric for the quality of any
Difficulty in assessing the usefulness of interpretations for different users
Problem of comparing different methods of understandability
If some problems or improvements in these areas have already been implemented, they can be ignored.
