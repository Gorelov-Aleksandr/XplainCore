Here are the priorities for further development of the XAI service, taking into account high business values, implementation complexity, and reliable integration for large IT companies (e.g. Yandex):

üìä 1. Adding more understandable AI methods (top priority)
Why it's important:

Expands the interpretability of the model using various approaches (SHAP, LIME, Anchors, Counterfactuals).
Increases user trust and ensures integration in regulated areas (finance, medtech).
Gives a competitive advantage when selling, this is a multi-methodological explanation.
What can be done:

SHAP integration (global and local interpretation).
Support for counterfeits (explanation through "what if").
Validation using domain-oriented approaches (e.g. checking traces on your own business cases).
üìà 2. Improving metrics (high priority)
Why it's important:

Ensure reliability of observations and increase transparency.
Important for decision-making in special situations (e.g. loan approval, diagnostics).
What can be done:

Introduce confidence intervals for observations.
Supported metrics: entropy, forecast reliability, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
üé® 3. Improving visualization parameters (medium priority)
Why it's important:

Improves user experience and understanding of complex issues.
Enables large clients (e.g. Yandex) to implement a solution with a ready-made user interface faster.
What can be done:

Integrate with Grafana (or create custom panels on Streamlit/FastAPI).
Preview: heat maps, decision paths, investment contribution.
üîç 4. Adding additional validation rules (medium priority)
Why it's important:

Reduces the likelihood of errors when working with uncorrected data.
Important when working with benefits and legal living conditions.
What can be done:

Checking for anomalies (e.g., too high a credit request).
Automatic boundary checking and compliance.
üóÇÔ∏è 5. Implementing persistent storage (medium priority)
Why it's important:

Allows you to record and analyze explanations dynamically.
Important for audit and validation solutions in large equipment.
What can be done:

Storing interests in PostgreSQL or ClickHouse.
Archiving and searching on request.
üìä 6. Creating a Diptych/interface panel (low priority, after implementing basic functions)
Why it's important:

Gives clients a convenient way to analyze results.
Important for further decisions in presentations and negotiations.
What can be done:

Dashboard with real explanations and metrics.
Preview of model performance and trace distribution (Jaeger, Grafana).
‚úÖ Final order of priorities:
Add more understandable AI methods (SHAP, counterfeits)
Increase the reliability of metrics (confidence intervals)
Improving visualization parameters (interactive graphs)
Adding additional validation rules (data validation)
Implementing persistent storage (logging subsequent events)
Creating a dashboard/interface (UI for visualization)
